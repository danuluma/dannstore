<!-- # WIP -->
This is the api backend for dann's bookstore. It's intended for use internally within a single store. There are currently two categories of users: attendants and admins/owner. Each user is identified by an access token which allows appropriate access level to be granted to him/her.
This api provides and interface for the users to interact with the database via the available rest endpoints.
